## Building The App

### Step1

Setup Enviroment Variables

| Env Name                | Value        | Default    | Explaination                            |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| CALC_ADD_ICON           | "ðŸ‘½"         | +          | Icon/Symbol for Addition operator       |
| CALC_ADD_PRECEDENCE     | "1"          | 1          | Precedence of Addition                  |
| CALC_SUB_ICON           | "ðŸ’€"         | -          | Icon/Symbol for Subtraction operator    |
| CALC_SUB_PRECEDENCE     | "1"          | 1          | Precedence of Addition                  |
| CALC_MULTI_ICON         | "ðŸ‘»"         | *          |                                         |
| CALC_MULTI_PRECEDENCE   | "2"          | 2          |                                         |
| CALC_DIV_ICON           | "ðŸ˜±"         | /          |                                         | 
| CALC_DIV_PRECEDENCE     | "2"          | 2          |                                         |
| API_BASIC_AUTH_USER     | "calculator" | "api"      | Set a Basic Auth user for the API       |
| API_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD | "password"   | "password" | Basic Auth Password for the API         |
| USE_PRECEDENCE          | true         | false      | Should the API use Equation Precedence? |

### Step2

To run the application from commandline 
Run 
```
composer install
npm install && npm run prod
```
note: php >= 8.1 required

Running this command will run the application in built in php server @ http://localhost:8000


#### Step2 (optional)

If you love docker, I used laravel sail to build the Application

run the below command
```
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
    
./vendor/bin/sail build
./vendor/bin/sail up -d 
```
